/**
 * Scan display "no cap" regression guard (v1.76.0).
 *
 * Both scanners store the full matched (post-filter) set as `filtered` in
 * data/last-scan.json. The #/scan table paginates them 200/page client-side, so
 * nothing is ever dropped — you turn pages to see everything.
 *
 * History:
 *  - Pre-v1.69.1: a hard `slice(0, 500)` per region silently truncated large
 *    sweeps (a real RU scan produced 1352 matching jobs, 852 hidden).
 *  - v1.69.1: raised to an env-overridable `MAX_STORED_RESULTS` (2000) — still a
 *    ceiling that large company lists hit.
 *  - v1.76.0: the cap was REMOVED entirely. `filtered` is stored verbatim.
 *
 * This guard makes sure the truncation never creeps back: neither scanner may
 * slice the `filtered` set, and the old `MAX_STORED_RESULTS` symbol must be gone.
