/**
 * Shared benign-console filter for the Playwright suites — one source of truth
 * so the per-file copies can't drift apart (this benign 404 has flaked several
 * suites as each grew its own, or no, filter).
 *
 * Deliberately narrow so it hides ONLY noise that is never a real client bug:
 *   - a favicon URL (`favicon.ico`), and
 *   - a "Failed to load resource" whose HTTP status is exactly 404 or 410
 *     (anchored to `status of <n>` so a 500 on a URL that merely contains
 *     "404" is NOT swallowed), and
 *   - an aborted / empty-response network teardown (`net::ERR_ABORTED`,
 *     `net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`) — the request was cancelled, not failed.
 * A 500 (a genuine server error), any other status, and every uncaught JS
 * exception all still surface, so the assertion keeps its real value.
 *
 * Other connection-teardown noise (a test that deliberately kills a live
 * connection: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED / "Failed to fetch" / "connection lost")
 * is NOT benign by default — the suite that induces it opts in via `extra`.
