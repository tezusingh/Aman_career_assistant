## What it is

Original website: [Jobindex](https://www.jobindex.dk/)

This extractor reads Jobindex search result pages and parses the embedded `var Stash = ...` payload that powers the browser result app. It supports Denmark searches with query terms and optional city filtering through Jobindex `geoareaid` resolution.

Implementation split:

1. `extractors/jobindex/src/run.ts` fetches `/jobsoegning?q=...`, resolves selected city locations through `storeData.geoareaOptions`, appends matching `geoareaid` filters, parses `searchResponse.results`, paginates with `page=2`, and maps rows into `CreateJobInput`.
2. `extractors/jobindex/src/manifest.ts` enforces Denmark-only runs, adapts pipeline settings, emits progress updates, and registers the source for runtime discovery.

## Why it exists

Jobindex is a strong local source for Denmark roles, and the embedded Stash payload exposes structured result data without needing browser rendering.

Using the page payload keeps the scraper small while still capturing company, location, dates, rating, listing URL, and direct application links when they appear in the result HTML.

## How to use it

1. Open **Run jobs** and choose **Automatic**.
2. Select **Denmark** as the country.
3. Leave **Jobindex** enabled in **Sources** or toggle it on.
4. Enter search terms such as:
   ```text
   software engineer
   platform engineer
   backend developer
   ```
5. Start the run and monitor list-page progress in the pipeline progress card.

Defaults and constraints:

- The extractor only runs when selected country is `denmark`.
- When city locations are selected, the extractor resolves them to Jobindex `geoareaid` filters and applies them on the search URL.
- `JOBINDEX_MAX_JOBS_PER_TERM` controls the default per-term cap when no automatic run budget override is present.
- Direct application links are parsed from the result card heading where available; otherwise the Jobindex listing URL is used.
- Job descriptions come from paragraph text in the result card, not from full detail-page scraping.

## Common problems

### Jobindex does not run

- Confirm the selected country is Denmark.
- Check that the app build includes `extractors/jobindex/src/manifest.ts` and the shared `jobindex` source metadata.

### Results are not filtered to a city

- City filtering only applies when the selected city can be resolved to a Jobindex `geoareaid`.
- If no match is found, the extractor falls back to the query-only URL for that search term.
- Danish names and common transliterations such as `Kobenhavn`, `Aabenraa`, and `Sonderborg` are supported.

### Application links point to Jobindex

- Some listings do not expose a direct external apply link in the result card.
- In those cases the extractor keeps the stable Jobindex listing URL so the job is still actionable.
