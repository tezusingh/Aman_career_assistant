# Error/Logging/Sanitization Standards

This project uses strict operability and privacy defaults for server-side code.

## API Response Contract

For all `/api/*` routes, return:

- Success: `{ ok: true, data, meta?: { requestId } }`
- Error: `{ ok: false, error: { code, message, details? }, meta: { requestId } }`

Use consistent status/code mapping:

- `400 INVALID_REQUEST`
- `401 UNAUTHORIZED`
- `403 FORBIDDEN`
- `404 NOT_FOUND`
- `408 REQUEST_TIMEOUT`
- `409 CONFLICT`
- `422 UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY`
- `500 INTERNAL_ERROR`
- `502 UPSTREAM_ERROR`
- `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`

## Correlation IDs

- Honor inbound `x-request-id` when present; otherwise generate one.
- Always return `x-request-id` header.
- Include request ID in API responses (`meta.requestId`) and logs.
- Propagate context into async flows (especially pipeline run and per-job work) so logs include `pipelineRunId` / `jobId` when available.

## Multi-Tenancy Defaults

- Treat every server-side change as multi-tenant by default.
- Before adding or changing storage, caching, background work, API routes, SSE streams, files, or external payloads, confirm how tenant/workspace context is selected, propagated, and enforced.
- Scope database reads/writes, filesystem paths, in-memory caches, queues, locks, rate limits, and long-lived process state by tenant/workspace unless the data is explicitly global.
- Never let module-level caches or singleton state hold tenant-specific profile, settings, job, PDF, chat, or integration data unless the cache key includes the active tenant/workspace.
- Include cross-tenant regression coverage when touching shared repositories, services, auth/session handling, profile/resume flows, PDF generation, Ghostwriter/tailoring, pipeline state, or settings.

## Logging Rules

- Use the shared logger wrapper (`infra/logger.ts`) in core server paths.
- Do not add direct `console.log`, `console.warn`, or `console.error` in core paths.
- Log structured objects, not free-form dumps.
- Include useful context fields (e.g. `requestId`, `pipelineRunId`, `jobId`, `route`, `status`).

## SSE Standards

- Use centralized SSE helpers by default.
- Server: use `orchestrator/src/server/infra/sse.ts` for setup, data writes, comments, and heartbeats.
- Client (`EventSource`): use `orchestrator/src/client/lib/sse.ts` for subscription/open/message/error plumbing.
- Do not duplicate raw SSE setup (`Content-Type`, `Connection`, heartbeat loops, or ad-hoc `JSON.parse` event parsing) when these helpers apply.
- Keep feature payload types domain-local (pipeline, ghostwriter, bulk actions), but reuse shared transport plumbing.

## Redaction and Sanitization

- Always sanitize objects before logging or returning in error `details`.
- Redact sensitive keys by default (`authorization`, `cookie`, `password`, `secret`, `token`, `apiKey`, etc.).
- Truncate large payloads and long strings.
- Do not throw/log raw upstream response bodies, full webhook bodies, or large `JSON.stringify(...)` blobs.

## Webhook and LLM Payload Defaults

- Webhooks: send minimal whitelisted payloads by default.
- LLM prompts: send only required profile/job fields; avoid unnecessary PII.
- Document external payload behavior when adding new integrations.

## PR Checklist (Routes/Services)

- API responses follow `{ ok, data/error, meta.requestId }`.
- Status/code mapping is correct and consistent.
- Request/correlation IDs appear in logs and async workflows.
- Tenant/workspace context is correctly scoped across storage, caches, async work, files, and external payloads.
- No raw sensitive payload logging or raw upstream body throws.
- New/changed webhook or LLM payloads are sanitized and documented.

## Documentation Standards (Condensed)

When adding or updating user-facing docs:

- Use this feature-page structure:
  1. **What it is**
  2. **Why it exists**
  3. **How to use it**
  4. **Common problems**
  5. **Related pages**
- Include frontmatter keys: `id`, `title`, `description`, `sidebar_position`.
- Prefer concrete, step-by-step instructions over abstract explanation.
- Include copy-pasteable examples where relevant.
- State defaults and constraints explicitly.
- Link related docs with `/docs/...` URLs.
- Any user-visible behavior change should include corresponding docs updates.

## Extractor Deployment Note

When adding a new extractor workspace under `extractors/`:

- Update `docker-compose.yml` develop/watch sync entries if the extractor needs live-reload behavior in local container development.
- Update all relevant `Dockerfile` stages so the extractor's `package*.json` files are copied before `npm install`, and the extractor directory itself is copied into build/runtime images.
- Update deployment coverage in `orchestrator/src/server/extractors/deployment.test.ts` so Docker/compose support is asserted for the new extractor.
- If this is missed, the source can appear in shared settings/UI but still fail at runtime as "not available at runtime" because the extractor manifest is not present inside the container.

## Validation / Verification

Before marking work complete, verify changes with the same checks used by CI.

### Required CI-parity checks

Run from repository root:

1. `./orchestrator/node_modules/.bin/biome ci .`
2. `npm run check:types:shared`
3. `npm --workspace orchestrator run check:types`
4. `npm --workspace gradcracker-extractor run check:types`
5. `npm --workspace ukvisajobs-extractor run check:types`
6. `npm --workspace orchestrator run build:client`
7. `npm --workspace orchestrator run test:run`

### Native module note (better-sqlite3)

If tests fail with a Node ABI mismatch for `better-sqlite3`, rebuild it before running tests:

- `npm --workspace orchestrator rebuild better-sqlite3`

CI runs on Node 22. If local behavior differs, verify with Node 22 before concluding a change is valid.

### Scope-specific checks

- For focused changes, run targeted tests first (for touched files/modules), then still run the full CI-parity list above before finalizing.
- A change is considered valid only when all required checks pass without ignored failures.

<!-- CODEGRAPH_START -->
## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.
