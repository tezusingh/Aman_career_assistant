# Job Ops Orchestrator

A unified orchestrator for the job application pipeline. Discovers jobs, scores them for suitability, generates tailored resumes, and provides a UI to manage applications.

```

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd orchestrator
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # The app is self-configuring. You can add keys via the UI Onboarding.
    ```

   After the server starts, onboarding saves your location and workplace defaults, verifies your LLM provider, and imports your resume. The parsed resume is shown for confirmation before setup completes. Search terms are chosen later when you start a run.

   You can edit the confirmed document later in **Resume Studio**. JobOps uses that document as the primary context for tailoring, scoring, and PDF generation.


   OpenRouter is the default LLM provider, but OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), GLM, LM Studio, Ollama, `openai-compatible` endpoints, and Gemini are also supported.

   Use `LLM_API_KEY` / `llmApiKey` to configure providers that require an API key.
   To use the native OpenAI integration, set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai`.
   To use Claude through Anthropic's native Messages API, set `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`.
   To use GLM through Z.AI, set `LLM_PROVIDER=glm`; the default base URL is `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4`.
   For third-party services that expose an OpenAI-style API but are not OpenAI itself, use `LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible`.

3. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

    This starts:
   - Backend API at `http://localhost:3001`
   - Frontend at `http://localhost:5173`

## API Endpoints

### Jobs

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/jobs` | List all jobs (filter with `?status=ready,discovered`) |
| GET | `/api/jobs/:id` | Get single job |
| PATCH | `/api/jobs/:id` | Update job |
| POST | `/api/jobs/actions` | Run job actions (`move_to_ready`, `rescore`, `skip`) for one or many jobs |
| POST | `/api/jobs/actions/stream` | Stream job action progress/events for one or many jobs |
| POST | `/api/jobs/:id/apply` | Mark as applied |

### Pipeline

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/pipeline/status` | Get pipeline status |
| GET | `/api/pipeline/runs` | Get recent pipeline runs |
| POST | `/api/pipeline/run` | Trigger pipeline manually |
| POST | `/api/webhook/trigger` | Webhook for n8n (use `WEBHOOK_SECRET`) |

### Post-Application Tracking

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/post-application/inbox` | List pending messages for review |
| POST | `/api/post-application/inbox/:id/approve` | Approve and link to job |
| POST | `/api/post-application/inbox/:id/deny` | Ignore message |
| GET | `/api/post-application/runs` | List sync run history |
| GET | `/api/post-application/providers/gmail/oauth/start` | Initiate Gmail OAuth flow |
| POST | `/api/post-application/providers/gmail/oauth/exchange` | Exchange OAuth code |

## Daily Flow

1. **17:00 - n8n triggers pipeline:**
   - Calls `POST /api/webhook/trigger`
   - Pipeline crawls Gradcracker
   - Scores jobs with AI
   - Generates tailored resumes for top 10

2. **You review in the UI:**
   - See jobs at `http://localhost:5173`
   - "Ready" tab shows jobs with generated PDFs
   - Use command bar search (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) to quickly find and open jobs
   - Click "View Job" to open application
   - Download PDF and apply manually
   - Click "Mark Applied" to mark application status

3. **Track responses (optional):**
   - Connect Gmail in Tracking Inbox settings
   - Automatic email monitoring for interview invites, offers, rejections
   - Review and approve/ignore matched emails in the Inbox

## n8n Setup

Create a workflow with:

1. **Schedule Trigger** - Every day at 17:00
2. **HTTP Request:**
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/webhook/trigger`
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Development

```bash
# Run just the server
npm run dev:server

# Run just the client
npm run dev:client

# Run the pipeline manually
npm run pipeline:run

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Express, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, SQLite
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, CSS (custom design system)
- **AI:** Configurable LLM provider (OpenRouter default; also supports OpenAI via the dedicated `openai` provider, Claude through Anthropic's native API, GLM, `openai-compatible` endpoints, Gemini, LM Studio, and Ollama)
- **PDF Generation:** Reactive Resume v5 API export (configured via Settings)
- **Job Crawling:** Wraps existing TypeScript Crawlee crawler
