# Contributing to JobOps

Thanks for helping improve JobOps.

This guide is intentionally short and GitHub-friendly. It focuses on contributor workflow and links to the existing docs for setup, style, and troubleshooting so we do not duplicate documentation.

## Contributor Terms

By submitting a pull request, patch, issue comment, documentation change, or other contribution to JobOps, you confirm that you have the right to contribute it and that you license your contribution to the JobOps maintainers and users under the project's current license terms.

You also grant the JobOps maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, distribute, sublicense, relicense, and commercially offer your contribution as part of JobOps, including official hosted JobOps services and other commercial offerings.

You keep ownership of your own contributions. This grant exists so JobOps can remain free for self-hosting while the maintainers can operate and sell official JobOps Cloud services under separate commercial terms.

Do not submit code, docs, assets, generated output, or other material that you do not have permission to contribute.

## What You Can Contribute

## Before You Start (Pick a Path)

Use the path that matches your change:

| Path | Main folders | Start command(s) | Canonical docs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docs/content | `docs-site/docs` | `npm run docs:dev` | [Docs style guide](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/next/reference/documentation-style-guide), [FAQ](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/next/reference/faq) |
| App/UI/API | `orchestrator`, `shared` | `npm --workspace orchestrator run dev` | [Self-hosting](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/getting-started/self-hosting), [Troubleshooting](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/next/troubleshooting/common-problems) |
| Watchlist source adapters | `orchestrator/src/server/watchlist/adapters`, `orchestrator/src/server/config` | `npm --workspace orchestrator run dev` | [Watchlist](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/next/features/watchlist) |
| Extractors | `extractors/*`, sometimes `shared` | Relevant type checks + tests | [Add an extractor](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/next/workflows/add-an-extractor), [Extractors overview](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/extractors/overview) |
| Typst resume themes | `orchestrator/src/server/services/resume-renderer/typst-themes` | `npm run typst-theme:validate` | [Reactive Resume](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/features/reactive-resume) |

## Local Setup (Minimal)

For full end-user setup, environment variables, OAuth, and deployment details, use the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/getting-started/self-hosting) and [Gmail OAuth Setup](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/getting-started/gmail-oauth-setup).

Contributor baseline from repo root:

```bash
npm ci
npm --workspace orchestrator run db:migrate
npm --workspace orchestrator run dev
```

If you are working with extractors that use Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn (powered by python-jobspy), set up the Python venv once:

```bash
python3 -m venv extractors/jobspy/.venv
extractors/jobspy/.venv/bin/pip install -r extractors/jobspy/requirements.txt
```

The runner auto-detects the venv — no need to set `PYTHON_PATH`.

If you are editing docs:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

Local URLs:

- Orchestrator UI: `http://localhost:5173`
- Orchestrator API: `http://localhost:3001`
- Docs site: `http://localhost:3006`

## How to Make a Change

1. Create a branch from `origin/main`.
2. Keep the PR focused on one change or one problem.
3. If the change is user-visible, update docs (or link the relevant docs update in the same PR).
4. Include screenshots or short clips for UI changes when helpful.
5. Mention any tradeoffs or follow-up work in the PR description.

## Adding Watchlist Sources

Watchlist sources are adapter-backed. The UI, API routes, dedupe behavior, import draft creation, and source-specific copy all read from the adapter registry.

### Adding a company to an existing source type

If a company uses an already supported source type, add it to that source type's catalog file in `orchestrator/src/server/config`.

For Workday, add the public careers site to `orchestrator/src/server/config/career-boards-workday.json`.

Use this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "company-workday",
  "label": "Company",
  "ats": "workday",
  "workdayUrl": "https://company.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/External",
  "tags": ["software", "engineering"],
  "countries": ["US", "UK"],
  "status": "active"
}
```

Rules:

- Add only public Workday careers URLs, not individual job posting URLs.
- Prefer the main external careers page for that tenant.
- Keep `id` stable and kebab-case.
- Keep `label` human-readable because it is shown directly in the Watchlist company picker.
- Use concise `tags` and broad `countries` values only when you are reasonably confident they are correct.

Before opening the PR:

- Launch the app and confirm the company appears in Watchlist search.
- Verify the URL resolves to the expected Workday site.
- Update docs if the user-visible flow changed.

### Adding a new source type

Add a source adapter under `orchestrator/src/server/watchlist/adapters`. The adapter should own:

- catalog entry parsing
- custom source URL validation and label derivation
- source-specific UI copy
- job fetching and normalized row output
- canonical job identity for ignore/check/dedupe
- job details and import draft preparation
- optional logo/branding lookup

Then register the adapter in `orchestrator/src/server/watchlist/adapters/index.ts`. If it has a curated company catalog, add `orchestrator/src/server/config/career-boards-{sourceType}.json`; the generic catalog loader will dispatch that file to the matching adapter.

Before opening the PR:

- Add adapter tests for catalog parsing, URL validation, job identity, and import draft preparation.
- Add or update Watchlist API/page tests when the source affects shared behavior.
- Confirm the source type appears in the Watchlist picker with adapter-owned copy.
- Update the Watchlist docs if the user-visible behavior changes.

## Adding a Typst Resume Theme

Typst themes are folder-based so a theme PR can stay small:

1. Copy an existing folder under `orchestrator/src/server/services/resume-renderer/typst-themes`.
2. Rename the folder and set the same kebab-case value in `theme.json` as `id`.
3. Update `label`, `description`, `entrypoint`, and native `tokens`.
4. Edit the Typst entrypoint, usually `main.typ`.
5. Run `npm run typst-theme:generate` to refresh shared theme metadata.
6. Run `npm run typst-theme:validate`.

Native themes use the JobOps resume document model and token placeholders. Adapted themes can read the normalized resume document from `json(__RESUME_DATA_PATH__)` inside their Typst entrypoint, which is the recommended path for Typst Universe packages with their own layout APIs.

## Releases

Releases are driven from GitHub Actions.

1. Open the `release` workflow in GitHub Actions.
2. Enter the next version as `x.y.z` (for example `0.1.30`).
3. Optionally enter a separate release title for GitHub (for example `Google Dorks!`).
4. Run the workflow.

The workflow will:

- bump `orchestrator/package.json`
- update `package-lock.json`
- cut the matching Docusaurus docs version
- commit the version bump to `main`
- create and push tag `vX.Y.Z`
- publish the `ghcr.io/.../job-ops` image for that release
- create the GitHub release using either the custom title or `vX.Y.Z`

The app version shown in the UI is sourced from `orchestrator/package.json`, so the release version, tag, and displayed app version stay aligned even when the GitHub release title is customized separately.

## Validation Before PR (CI-Parity Checks)

Run from the repository root:

```bash
./orchestrator/node_modules/.bin/biome ci .
npm run check:types:shared
npm --workspace orchestrator run check:types
npm --workspace gradcracker-extractor run check:types
npm --workspace ukvisajobs-extractor run check:types
npm --workspace orchestrator run build:client
npm --workspace orchestrator run test:run
```

If tests fail due to a `better-sqlite3` Node ABI mismatch, rebuild it and rerun tests:

```bash
npm --workspace orchestrator rebuild better-sqlite3
```

CI runs on Node 22. If local behavior differs, verify with Node 22 before concluding a change is valid.

## Project-Specific Standards (Link-First)

Before editing server routes/services, read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for repository standards, especially:

- `/api/*` response contract and status/code mapping
- Correlation/request IDs (`x-request-id`) and logging context
- Shared logger usage in core server paths (no direct `console.*`)
- SSE helper usage
- Redaction/sanitization defaults for logs and error details
- Minimal webhook and LLM payload defaults
